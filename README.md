# SSL-GUI
A GUI able to demonstrate the results of a sound source localization drone.

After collecting data from a drone, the results are store in a folder and it's tedious to view one at a time.
I created these codes to ease myself to view the results which includes some fascinating features from pyrooomacoutics with references from other coders.
