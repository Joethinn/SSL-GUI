# SSL-GUI
A GUI able to demonstrate the results of a sound source localization drone.

After collecting data from a drone, the results are store in a folder and it's tedious to view one at a time.
I created these codes to ease myself to view the results which includes some fascinating features from pyrooomacoutics with references from other coders.

You can download the pictures and test_images for better experience.
You can also view "Sample GUI prompt", it shows the outcome of the codes.
